# Permeable-membrane-simulator
It's my first simulator. I am trying to simulate the reaction of a permeable membrane with different pore sizes, number of particles, and temperature to control the movement speed. That will help apply the osmosis concept practically, supporting the studying process.

I made it using Visual Studio Code with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It's for educational simulation.
